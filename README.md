But Wait! How is this platform different from Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook, e.t.c.? Well, it is true that Changamka! Is similar to the social media platforms but with caveat. Changamka! Is loca, targetting local youths, thus creating a niche space that eliminates the saturation in other platforms. Most Importantly, the platform provides users with the ability to showcase their stuff, which in effect inspires them to bring their dreams to life, which in effect evokes them to practice and thus so become perfect; ni kuchangamka!
